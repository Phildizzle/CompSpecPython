## Read me

This github repository contains the code I developed while taking the 7-course *Fundamentals of Computing*-Specialization offered by Rice University on Coursera ([Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)). Each course is estimated to take students 4-5 weeks.
The course uses Python 2.6 and introduces advanced programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, unit-tests, Monte-Carlo methods, 
by embedding discrete mathematic problems and basic algorithms into programming assignments designed as games. The assignments get progressively harder so if you are interested in the more difficult programs, you know where to look.

The course makes use of an in-browser IDE which imports custom moduls/libraries and delivers a simple quick GUI. 
It can be found under www.Codeskulptor.org. If you want to run the program you should be running the code in this environment for the reasons above. Just hit the play-button in the top-left corner and the code will compile.

### Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python

Intensive 8-week course which introduces intermediate concepts.

1. Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_Lg0H63R5aO_0.py):

(Statements, expressions, variables)

Simple program where two AI's play the famous nerd-extended rock-paper-scissors game.

2. Guess the number [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_MIiz9FfVK5CHCvh.py):

(Functions, logic, conditionals)

Simple game where you input-guess a number between 100 or 1000.

3. Stop watch [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_C5j3HYI1W3BSiMm.py):

(Event-driven programming, local/global variables)

Stop a stop watch and get points for it.

4. Pong [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_YzF5OpfR80Vai0Z.py):

(Canvas, drawing, timers, lists, keyboard input, the basics of modeling motion)

Simple version of the classic game

5. Memory [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_0C5jQRoIYBa9lKt.py):

(Mouse input, list methods, dictionaries methods)

Implementation of the classic with 16 tiles

6. Blackjack [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_NZUdlGFamJIEMj3.py):

(Classes and object-oriented programming)

1-Player Blackjack version, it's really fun!

7. Spaceship [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_5xGTnFEg0a0eCGO.py):

(More object-oriented programming, basic game physics, sprites)

Spaceship with friction and missiles on a self-designed canvas (pre-program for Asteroid)

8. RiceRocks/Asteroids [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_EyM1czNWEvpeGYM.py):

(Sets and animation)

Implementation of the classic arcade game

### Principles for Computing

Second 8-week course which dives into more advanced concepts with a focus on computing.

1. Merge function [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_qIHvvT0xnlzp8Cu.py):

(More object-oriented programming)

Handler function for the next project

2. 2048 [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_dxHyVMHDzWMYYz3.py):

(Testing, plotting, and grids)

Python implementation of the famous game

3. Tic-Tac-Toe (Monte-Carlo simulation [Link](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_7d1AFu3e4tlBHHg.py)):

(Probability, randomness, and objects/references)

Play the classic against an AI which you can train 

4. Yahtzee [Link]():

"Helper"-function for Yahtzee-strategy

(Combinatorics, generators, and debugging)

5. CookieClicker [Link]():

(Higher functions,...)

TBC! I still work on the course and will continually my solutions if they are correct :)

If you have any questions feel free to drop me a message. In case you like/used the projects feel free to fork/download it :)

Hint: If you want to run this with Python 3.3+ most of the time adding brackets to the (few) print statements will do the job. If you stumble across bigger problems, let me know!
