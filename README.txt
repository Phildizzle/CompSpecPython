This github repository contains the code I developed while taking the 7-course *Fundamentals of Computing*-Specialization offered by Rice University on Coursera ([Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)). Each course is estimated to take students 4-5 weeks.
The course uses Python and introduces advanced programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, unit-tests, Monte-Carlo methods, 
by embedding discrete mathematic problems and basic algorithms into programming assignments designed as games. The assignments get progressively harder so if you are interested in the more difficult programs, you know where to look.

The course makes use of an in-browser IDE which imports custom moduls/libraries and delivers a simple quick GUI. 
It can be found under www.Codeskulptor.org. If you want to run the program you should be running the code in this environment for the reasons above.

The links can be found under:
